# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Data-Science-Project
In this project various Machine learning algorithms are applied to predict the loan approval of customers. ML Techniques are
very useful in predicting outcomes for large amount of Data.
The main focus is to determine whether the loan given to a particular person or an organization shall be approved or not.
The project uses a dataset of past loan applications to build models using algorithms like decision trees, logistic regression
and using library tools such as matplotlib, pandas and seaborn
